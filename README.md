OECD Better Life Index and GDP per Capita Analysis
Datasets
We have uploaded two datasets for our analysis:

OECD Better Life Index 2015 (oecd_bli_2015.csv):

This dataset contains various indicators of well-being for OECD countries, including life satisfaction.
Each row represents a country with multiple columns indicating different measures of well-being.
GDP per Capita 2015 (gdp_per_capita.csv):

This dataset provides the GDP per capita for various countries.
The data is tab-separated and contains GDP values along with the respective country names.
Analysis
We have combined the data from these two datasets to explore the relationship between GDP per capita and life satisfaction across different countries.

Data Preparation
To prepare the data, we have:

Filtered and cleaned the OECD data to extract the life satisfaction information.
Merged the OECD data with the GDP data based on country names.
Ensured the data is sorted and aligned for accurate analysis.
Visualization
We have plotted a graph to visualize the relationship between GDP per capita and life satisfaction. This scatter plot helps in understanding how economic wealth (GDP per capita) correlates with the subjective well-being (life satisfaction) of individuals in different countries.

Predictive Modeling
A linear model has been used to predict life satisfaction based on GDP per capita. This model aims to quantify the relationship and make predictions about life satisfaction given a country's GDP per capita.
